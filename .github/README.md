## Building Scene Builder ##

### Requisites ###

Gluon Scene Builder is frequently released, and this is only required in case you want to fork and build your local version of Scene Builder.

These are the requisites:

* A recent version of [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for building 'master' branch
* A recent version of [JDK 9 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for building 'integration-9' branch

### How to build Scene Builder ###

To build the Scene Builder services, on the project's root, run:

`./gradlew clean build`

It will create an executable jar under `app/build/libs/scenebuilder-$version-all.jar`.
